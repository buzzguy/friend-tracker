## Inspiration

This plugin was inspired by [Scott Stockdale's article on maintaining meaningful friendships](https://entrepreneurscanparty.com/posts/how-to-be-a-more-awesome-friend). The core idea is that maintaining strong relationships requires a system for:

-   Tracking important dates and milestones
-   Recording meaningful interactions
-   Remembering personal details
-   Making regular meaningful touchpoints

Friend Tracker helps implement these relationship-building practices in a simple, organized way within Obsidian.
